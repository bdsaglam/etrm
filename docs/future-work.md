- Use pretrained TRM with all weights to initialize decoder and repeat training runs
- Contrastive loss for encoder: encourage encoder to produce similar representations for demos from SAME puzzle and different representations for demos from DIFFERENT puzzles
- LPN style gradient-based optimization in latent space + TRM
- ARC-AGI 2 benchmark
