# Abstract

<!-- Write last - after all other sections are complete -->

## Outline

- **Problem**: TRM achieves 45% on ARC-AGI but relies on puzzle_id memorization, not true few-shot learning
- **Approach**: Replace puzzle_id embeddings with a demonstration encoder that extracts task rules from demo pairs
- **Key experiments**: Tested multiple encoder architectures (standard, hybrid, LPN variants)
- **Results**: [To be filled after experiments complete]
- **Conclusion**: [Main takeaway about feasibility of encoder-based approach]
